Set-up of portfolio containing some examples of my early work

Must include:
```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

Comments: 
1. I realise that I have built more of a resume than a portfolio of work due to not having any (good?) work to include yet. 
2. I have attempted to fulfil the criteria above but have not been totally successful.
3. I have left some comments in both the HTML & CSS pages about corections & additions still to make & envision I will continue to build this website as I learn more & have more Web Development work to showcase.  (I will then replace the other sections (eg. Account Management & New Product Development) which I have used here as placeholder images & names.)
4. I am not cofident about the fonts, though, as when I published the third commit, the webpage did not look like the one I was seeing on my desktop.
